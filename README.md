Dreamteam - Eredivisie
======================
A football dreamteam game

*Dreamteam - Eredivisie* is an app which will allow the user to select a dreamteam for an organised dreamteam-game. In this particular game you get a transfer budget to start with, with which you will assemble your team. You have to buy 18 players to fill your squad, one for every team taking part in de Dutch *Eredivisie*. You can have no more than one player from every team. Your squad consists of 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 6 midfielders and 5 attackers. After you have assembled your team, post it to the organiser of the game.
